# Login/Signup Application with Backend Functionality
This repository contains a basic implementation of a login/signup application with backend functionality. The application allows users to sign up, log in, and view content available only to authenticated users. It demonstrates the integration of frontend and backend components, using technologies like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and bcrypt for secure password handling.
## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/login-signup-app.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd login-signup-app
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Node.js packages by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start MongoDB**: Ensure that your MongoDB server is up and running. If not, start it using:
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```
5. **Run the Application**: Start the Node.js server to run the backend of the application:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   The server will start on port 3000.
6. **Access the Application**: Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the frontend of the application.
## Usage
- **Sign Up**: Enter a username and password in the signup form and click "Sign Up." The backend will securely hash the password and store the user data in the MongoDB database.
- **Login**: Use the credentials from the signup process to log in via the login form. The backend will compare the provided password with the stored hashed password to authenticate the user.
## Backend Implementation
- The backend is built using Node.js and Express, providing routes for user signup and login.
- User passwords are securely hashed using the bcrypt library before being stored in the database.
- MongoDB is used to store user data, and the application connects to the local MongoDB server.
## Frontend Implementation
- The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The signup and login forms collect user input and make HTTP requests to the backend for user registration and authentication.
## Security Considerations
- This project demonstrates basic security practices, such as password hashing. In a production environment, additional security measures would be necessary, including HTTPS, input validation, and more advanced authentication methods.
